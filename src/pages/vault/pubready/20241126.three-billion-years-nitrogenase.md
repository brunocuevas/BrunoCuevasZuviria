Last week, we released our latest pre-print, available [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.18.623660v1). Our study aims to understand the evolutionary history of Nitrogenase over the past 3 billion years. We employed a combined approach involving ancestral sequence reconstruction, AlphaFold-based protein structure prediction, and structural characterization.

This publication introduces a new feature I developed: a Streamlit-based web server that provides access to all our predictions. The server is hosted at [**nsdb.bact.wisc.edu**](http://nsdb.bact.wisc.edu/) and offers an intuitive interface to explore the temporal evolution and structures of Nitrogenases. Implementing this server was challenging, primarily due to the stringent security requirements for deploying a URL under the wisc.edu domain.

**As the paper is currently a pre-print, I would greatly appreciate any comments or feedback you might have on our work.**
