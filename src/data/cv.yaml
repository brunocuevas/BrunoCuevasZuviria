summary:
- I am a computational biology researcher with 10 years of professional experience. I have applied my molecular and mathematical modelling skills in different areas of research, such as the molecular basis of allergy, the interface of machine-learning and quantum chemistry, the epidemiology of plant-viruses, the evolution of proteins, and the origins of life. This research experience also allows me to teach advanced college courses in structural computational biology and protein structure. Among my main achievements, I count the methodology for the prediction of electron densities, the creation of the first prebiotic chemistry database, or the prediction of 5k Nitrogenase extant and ancestral structures.
